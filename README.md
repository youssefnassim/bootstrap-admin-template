## Introduction

A brutalist admin template based on Bootstrap. It's still a work in progress, or rather in it's starting phase.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youssefnassim/bootstrap-admin-template.git my-app
# Clone the repo

cd my-app
# Cd into the directory
  
npm install
# Install dependencies
```

### Usage

```bash
npm start
# Serve with hot reloading
```

Components are written in vanilla JavaScript, so when Bootstrap 5 is officially released, jQuery will be dropped.
